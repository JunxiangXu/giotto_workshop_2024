```

## From matrix + locations

```
createGiottoObject()
```

## From subcellular raw data (transcripts or images) + polygons

```
createGiottoObjectSubcellular()
```


## From piece-wise

```
g <- giotto()
g <- setGiotto(g, ??)
```

## Using convenience functions for popular technologies (Vizgen, Xenium, CosMx, â€¦)

```
createGiottoVisiumObject()
createGiottoXeniumObject()
createGiottoCosMxObject()
createGiottoMerscopeObject()
```

## Mini objects & GiottoData

Giotto makes available several mini objects to allow devs and users to work
with easily loadable Giotto objects. These are small subsets of a larger
dataset that often contain some worked through analyses and are fully functional.
